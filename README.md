The COVID-19 pandemic has had different impacts in different regions of the world. Your challenge is to perform a comparative analysis of the pandemicâ€™s economic impacts in urban areas for the USA, Asia, and Europe using the EO Dashboard.

# Background
2020: under the pandemic wave, the world slowed down. Industries and transports were heavily impacted and beyond the effects on private lives and social interactions, the pandemic had repercussions on the environment. The question leading us was how much of these changes we could actually see in data from satellite. We focused on variations in greenhouse gases (SO2, NO2, O3, CO) and ozone, and on the differences of these variations across different world countries. To this end we performed a time-oriented analysis on time series and a complementary geography-oriented analysis, based on unsupervised feature extracting, to highlight differences between countries.

# Objectives
Out aim is to create a feasible application to the EODashboard in order to quantify the socio-economic impacts that the pandemic has had on different cuntries. We perform using different varibles from the Copernicus Sentinel 5. 

# How to Use

- First of all data must be retreived from Sentinel hub platform by using the file: S5PL2.ipynb
- After that the data for all the countries must be stored using the merge_file.ipybn
- Different type of analysis can be done at this point:
-
